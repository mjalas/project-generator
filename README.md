# Project Generator tool

**Still in very early development**

Tool for generating the initial structure for a project.

## Installation

For now the only option is to clone the repository and install the tool with *setup.py*.
Since the tool is still in very early development, it is recommended to install the
tool in a separate virtual environment.


## Usage

To get started, run the **project** command which shows what can be done with the tool.

More documentation coming soon...


## Change log

The change log can be found [here](CHANGELOG.md).
